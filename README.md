# pjmBlog

A Simple Blog Page.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to create a Blog site with simple features that can CREATE and DISPLAY Blog posts and also add comments to the Blog post. This project is to help showcase understanding of API design, Database Design, Front-end development and Back-end development. The major goal is learn how to consume API at the backend and developing a good software with a futuristic build.

## Built With
### This project was built with the following technology;

 * Express JS
 * MongoDB: For Database 
 * React JS: A JavaScript Library
 * Bootstrap 5


## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it the your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
